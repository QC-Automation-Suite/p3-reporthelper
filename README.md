# QC Report Helper Read Me

---

## Overview

The QC Report Helper automation is here to help make the process of finishing and filling out information regarding QC and the different batches easier.  Not only will this robot make it easier to fill out information, it will also make it faster and much more organized when filling out said information.

This automation designed to store and implement data processing following the _Dispatcher-Peformer_ automation model. Stored data will be extracted from data given by Caliber and Survey Monkey. This data will automatically fill the required fields of a survey in MS Forms; excluding three required manual inputs. At itsâ€™ end, the automation will create a pdf file and send it in an email.
